# Manage Shades

Generate complete color shade palettes from any base color. Automatically create lighter and darker variations (50-900) with mathematically precise steps, ensuring perceptual uniformity across your design tokens without manual adjustments.

# Manage Scale Ratio

Define the mathematical ratio that drives your design system's scale progression. Adjust a single multiplier to proportionally affect spacing, typography, and sizing tokens—maintaining harmonious relationships across all design elements.

# Bulk Editing

Edit multiple design tokens simultaneously using a spreadsheet-style interface. Select, modify, and update values across your entire token collection in one operation, dramatically reducing repetitive manual work.

# Nodes

Visualize and navigate the relationships between your design tokens. See how variables connect to each other through aliases and references, making it easy to understand dependencies and trace value inheritance.

# Contrast Checker

Verify color accessibility compliance in real-time. Automatically calculate contrast ratios between foreground and background color tokens, ensuring your palette meets WCAG 2.1 guidelines for readable, accessible designs.
